Hello! My name is Jessiree. My interest in programming started way back in high school when we were taught about the basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS - which also inspired me to take up Computer Science in university. Moving forward to the present, I am now a software engineer who has worked with several startup founders which involved building apps from the ground-up: from planning the software and data architecture to shipping functional applications used by their customers.

## My Current Stack

* TypeScript, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, React, Material UI
